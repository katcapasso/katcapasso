### Hi there I'm Katherine. ðŸ‘‹
I am passionate about data analyst and security software. I've been teaching myself machine learning and n.l.p.
I love learning. Ask me anything. I'm at an intermediate level! (won't mind leveling up though!)
Currently working on a company my sisters and I started,that pertains to importing and exporting. I'm working on the import export software that deals with wholesalers and distributors. Working on functionality and inventory logistics. I'm trying my best!
